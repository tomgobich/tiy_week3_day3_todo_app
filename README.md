# To Do App

##### The Iron Yard - Week 3, Day 3

For this assignment we were given a fully designed To Do application that had no JavaScript. We were to add the functionality to the application via JavaScript in order to get the application to work as expected.

### Our tasks were as follows:
- Make a new ToDo task using the text entered into the input box when the users hits the 'enter' key on their keyboard.
- Clicking on the 'X' with class 'delete' should delete that task
- Clicking on the circle with class 'check' should toggle tasks completion state
- Clicking on 'Active' on the bottom nav should only display the incomplete tasks
- Clicking on 'Completed' on the bottom nav should only display the completed tasks
- Clicking on 'All' on the bottom nav should display all tasks, completed and incomplete
- The span with class 'incomplete-items' should display the number of tasks currently incomplete

### Additional features added atop the required:
- All tasks and current view state are saved and loaded from local storage
- If user adds task while viewing all or active tasks the user will remain on that view state, but if the user adds a task while viewing completed tasks the user will be taken to active tasks so the user can see their new task
- Basic input validation to make sure the user entered something on submit

### Tech Used

- JavaScript (Other files were provided)
