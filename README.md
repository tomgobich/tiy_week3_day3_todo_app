# To Do App

##### The Iron Yard - Week 3, Day 3

For this assignment we were given a fully designed To Do application that had no JavaScript. We were to add the functionality to the application via JavaScript in order to get the application to work as expected.

Our tasks were as follows:
- Make a new ToDo task using the text entered into the input box when the users hits the 'enter' key on their keyboard.
- Clicking on the 'X' with class 'delete' should delete that task
- Clicking on the circle with class 'check' should toggle tasks completion state
- Clicking on 'Active' on the bottom nav should only display the incomplete tasks
- Clicking on 'Completed' on the bottom nav should only display the completed tasks
- Clicking on 'All' on the bottom nav should display all tasks, completed and incomplete
- The span with class 'incomplete-items' should display the number of tasks currently incomplete

Additional features added atop the required:
- All tasks and current view state are saved and loaded from local storage
